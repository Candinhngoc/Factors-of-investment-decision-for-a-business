# Factors of investment decision for a business
### Using R
## Data collection and input:
I chose Vingroup Joint Stock Company from 2011 to 2023 by quarter include 4 variables is Total assets, Leverage, Investment and Net fixed asset. I split the data into 2 parts is before and after 2020.

I was descriptive statistics (Min, Max, Mean, Median, Standard deviation) of all the variables. I provided box & whisker plot and histogram of Total asset variable and Leverage variable.

Perform multiple regression to determine the significant determinants of the variable of assigned topic. The significance level is 10%. There are 2 models to run:
1. With all the individual variables (model 1)
- Interpret the estimation result (R2, coefficients of variables, the significance of the model) of the model
2. With the usual individual variables and the interaction between Covid-19 dummy variable and the independent variables (model 2)
- Interpret the estimation result (R2, coefficients of variables, the significance of the model) of the model
3. Predict the value of the variable of assigned topic for all the quarters of the sample using Model 1

Perform ARIMA model to predict the variable of interest for the 4 quarters in 2022 and compare them with the realistic data
